                        Doña Teodora was said to have suffered the greatest pain during the delivery of her seventh
                        child, Jose. Her daughter Narcisa recalled: "I was nine years of age when my mother gave birth
                        to jose. I recall it vividly because my mother suffered great pain. She labored for a long time.
                        Her pain was later attributed to the fact that Jose's head was bigger than normal".</div>

                    A phenom is someone who is exceptionally talented or admired, especially an up-and-comer. Rizal,
                    especially during his childhood, was none less than a phenom. Jose Rizal's first memory in his
                    infancy, was his happy days in their family garden when he was three years old. Their courtyard
                    contained tropical fruit trees, poultry yard, a carriage house, and a stable for the ponies. Because
                    the young Pepe was weak, sickly, and undersized, he was given the fondest care by his parents, so
                    his father built a nipa cottage for Pepe to play in the daytime. Memory of his infancy included the
                    nocturnal walk in the town, especially when there was a moon. Jose also recalled the "aya"
                    (nursemaid) relating to the Rizal children some fabulous stories, like those about the fairies,
                    tales of buried treasure, and trees blooming with diamonds.</div>

                        Realonda, also known as "Lolay," was born on November 8 1826 in Santa Cruz. Manila. It is
                        believed that Doña Teodora's family descended from Lakandula, the last native king of Tondo.
                        Through the Claveria decree of 1849 which changed the Filipino native surnames, the Alonsos
                        adopted the surname Realonda. Rizal's mother thus became Teodora Alonso Quintos Realonda.</div>
