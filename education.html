                        Rizal was inspired to study ophthalmology by his mother's failing eyesight and his desire to
                        help her. In the late 19th century, ophthalmology was already a separate specialty, but there
                        were no organized residency programs. Most postgraduate training was obtained in preceptorships
                        under the tutelage of well-known professors. Rizal first studied the eye under the famous French
                        ophthalmologist, Louis de Wecker (1832-1906). Although he held no academic position, de Wecker
                        was a prolific author and an active teacher. He introduced ophthalmoscopy into France and
                        advanced ocular surgery. He modified cataract and strabismus surgery, devised a new method of
                        enucleation, advocated sclerotomy for the treatment of glaucoma, and was the first to use the
                        term filtration.4 The de Wecker iris scissors are still in use. Rizal served as assistant at de
                        Wecker's clinic from November 1885 to February 1886.</div><br>

                    <div> The first education and first teacher of Rizal was in her house and her Mother. In his
                        memoirs, Rizal
                        wrote. "My mother taught me how to read and to say haltingly the humble prayers which I raised
                        fervently
                        to God".
                        A highly educated woman of fine culture which is Doña Teodora has the capacity to teach Spanish,
                        reading, poetry, and values through rare story books. On her lap, Jose learned the alphabet and
                        Catholic
                        prayers at the age of three, learned to read and write at the age of 5.
                        Aside from his mother, Saturnina and his three uncle also mentored him. Jose Alberto taught him
                        painting, sketching, and sculpture Uncle Gregorio influenced him to further love reading Uncle
                        Manuel,
                        for his part. developed Rizal's physical skills in martial arts, like wrestling.
                        To enhance what Rizal had learned private tutors were hired to give him lessons at home. Thus,
                        Maestro
                        Celestino tutored him, and Maestro Lucas Padua later succeeded Celestino Afterward, a former
                        classmate
                        of Don Francisco, Leon Monroy lived at the Rizal home to become the boy's tutor in Spanish and
                        Latin.
